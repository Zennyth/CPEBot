### Improvements

We wish to provide the most secure version of this application but we're just IT students, we don't know much about security.
If you have an idea about how to improve our security system, here are some requirements :
- The server needs to webscrap CPE's website. (The server must know the credentials email:password in order to log in)
- I've deployed the service with my wn money so you need to think of a "simple solution"

Please contact me by email if you think of a better solution.
